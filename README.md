### 👨🏻 About me
I'm a software engineer with over 3 years of experience working in the tech industry.

My career in tech began in 2022 when I joined **Policy in Practice**, a SaaS start-up/scale-up that provides software solutions to help local authorities support their residents more effectively.

### 🎓 Background

I actually started out in a completely different field—nutrition! I graduated with a degree in **Nutrition and Dietetics** in 2018.

While I'm still passionate about nutrition, I’ve always had a deep interest in technology and software development. In 2020, I started teaching myself Python and quickly fell in love with coding.

I decided to pursue this passion more seriously and applied for a conversion course: the **MSc in Computer Science** at Birkbeck, University of London. I graduated in 2022 with **distinction**.
